Okay so Logistic Regression. It is sorta like linear regression?
Except instead of trying to find a linear relationship between the two variables,
you are trying to classify the points based on some probabilities.
Okay, time for you to do more research about it I guess xD.

Input format:
The first line contains an Integer N: Total number of points
The next N lines describes the N points with their x and y coordinate value in that order.
Note that since this is a binary classification, y can be only either 1 or 2.

Like the last problem. You will submit two numbers separated by a comma (a,b),
which describes the curve y = (e^(ax + b))/(1 + e^(ax + b))
