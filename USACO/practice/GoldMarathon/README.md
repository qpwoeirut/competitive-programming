# November 2020 USACO Gold Marathon

Starting Thursday, November 12th, I want to solve (or re-solve) every USACO Gold problem from December 2015 onwards. This is in preparation for the upcoming USACO contest season, which will start in December.

    - Knapsack DP
Bessie's Dream (dream): 5:41pm
    - BFS with 4-D states

## January 2016

    - Wrote an N^2 log N^2 with hashing, distance precomp
    - Had to look up the ccw function
    - N <= 200 so I didn't have to do N^2 log N^2 but I did anyways

Stopped because of Chemistry H Unit 2 Test tomorrow
