I finished with a perfect score for my first full practice session. The problem set was for the December 2017 competition bronze division.
Out of the 4 hours I think you are allotted, I finished with 45 minutes 39 seconds to spare.
The timer started about 1:05 pm and ended about 4:20 pm.
The date is Thursday, March 22, 2018. I'm not at school because most of the teachers are at some conference or meeting.
The USACO US Open 2018 starts tomorrow!
